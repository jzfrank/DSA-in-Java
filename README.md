# DSA-in-Java

Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in Java.

I have learned DSA in C++ in a summer at my third year of college. However, as time goes by, it seems that I failed to implement many interesting data structures or algorithms from scratch (although using them and solving leetcode is not really a problem for me). I love this subject. Recently I am also learning Java. Therefore, I will reimplment many famous DSA in Java here.
